bubble is a next-generation, blockchain-based, social media platform which was built from the ground up 
using node.js, socket.io and p5.js to provide a dynamic environment that mimics a social media experience 
while remaining a mostly self-contained node in a web of peers. bubble uses the latest advancements in 
p2p networking and web technology to create a blazingly fast, lightweight network that can run on most 
any device. bubble is the true marketplace of ideas because bubble was designed to preserve, maintain 
and monetize free speech regardless of ideology.

Censorship is 
not an option
bubble can’t censor you 
because you are in control of 
your profile and data. This is 
achieved via a web of 
independent lists of bubbles 
posted by each user and 
linked together through a 
pointer and a transaction 
recorded to the blockchain. 
There is no “Owner” but you.
Permissionless 
Public Space
We are building the world’s 
only, true digital commons 
with public service and 
accountability in mind. You 
will be 100% responsible for 
your actions with your 
reputation clearly visible and 
determined by your peers. 
Self- Monetized

bubble is more than a 
network, it is its own 
economy designed to be fair 
and with the future in mind. 
bubble uses “Monetary 
Balancing” to create an 
almost infinite supply that 
remains deflationary
